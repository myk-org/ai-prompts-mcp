## üö® CRITICAL: SESSION ISOLATION & FLOW ENFORCEMENT

**THIS PROMPT DEFINES A STRICT, SELF-CONTAINED WORKFLOW THAT MUST BE FOLLOWED EXACTLY:**

1. **IGNORE ALL PREVIOUS CONTEXT**: Previous conversations, tasks, or commands in this session are IRRELEVANT
2. **START FRESH**: This prompt creates a NEW workflow that starts from Step 1 and follows the exact sequence below
3. **NO ASSUMPTIONS**: Do NOT assume any steps have been completed - follow the workflow from the beginning
4. **MANDATORY CHECKPOINTS**: Each phase MUST complete fully before proceeding to the next phase
5. **REQUIRED CONFIRMATIONS**: All user confirmations (commit, push) MUST be asked - NEVER skip them

**If this prompt is called multiple times in a session, treat EACH invocation as a completely independent workflow.**

## Instructions

**Step 1: Get human review comments using the extraction script**

```bash
# Call the human review extraction script with PR info script path
{{SCRIPT_PATHS}}
```

**Step 2: Process the JSON output**

The script returns structured JSON containing:

- `summary`: Total count of human review comments
- `comments`: Array of review comments from human reviewers
  - Each has: reviewer, file, line, body

**Step 3: PHASE 1 - Collect User Decisions (COLLECTION ONLY - NO PROCESSING)**

**üö® CRITICAL: This is the COLLECTION phase. Do NOT execute, implement, or process ANY comments yet. Only ask questions and create tasks.**

Go through ALL comments sequentially, collecting user decisions:

**IMPORTANT: Present each comment individually, WAIT for user response, but NEVER execute, implement, or process anything during this phase.**

For each comment, present:
```
üë§ Human Review - Comment X of Y
üë®‚Äçüíª Reviewer: [reviewer name]
üìÅ File: [file path]
üìç Line: [line]
üí¨ Comment: [body]

Do you want to address this comment? (yes/no/skip/all)
```

**For each "yes" response:**
- Create a TodoWrite task with appropriate agent assignment
- Show confirmation: "‚úÖ Task created: [brief description]"
- **DO NOT execute the task - Continue to next comment immediately**

**For "all" response:**
- Create TodoWrite tasks for the current comment AND **ALL remaining comments** automatically
- **CRITICAL**: "all" means process EVERY remaining comment - do NOT skip any comments
- Show summary: "‚úÖ Created tasks for current comment + X remaining comments"
- **Skip to Phase 2 immediately**

**For "no" or "skip" responses:**
- Show: "‚è≠Ô∏è Skipped"
- Continue to next comment immediately

**üö® REMINDER: Do NOT execute, implement, fix, or process anything during this phase. Only collect decisions and create tasks.**

**Step 4: PHASE 2 - Process All Approved Tasks (EXECUTION PHASE)**

**üö® IMPORTANT: Only start this phase AFTER all comments have been presented and decisions collected.**

After ALL comments have been reviewed in Phase 1:

1. **Show approved tasks and proceed directly:**

```
üìã Processing X approved tasks:
1. [Task description]
2. [Task description]
...
```
Proceed directly to execution (no confirmation needed since user already approved each task in Phase 1)

2. **Process all approved tasks:**
   - **üö® CRITICAL**: Process ALL tasks created during Phase 1
   - **NEVER skip tasks** - if a task was created in Phase 1, it MUST be executed in Phase 2
   - Route to appropriate specialists using Task tool based on comment content
   - Process multiple tasks in parallel when possible
   - Mark each task as completed after finishing

3. **Post-execution workflow (PHASES 3 & 4 - MANDATORY CHECKPOINTS):**

   **PHASE 3: Testing & Commit**
   - **STEP 1** (REQUIRED): Use Task tool to run all tests
   - **STEP 2** (REQUIRED): If tests pass, MUST ask: "All tests pass. Do you want to commit the changes? (yes/no)"
     - If user says "yes": Use Task tool to commit changes with descriptive message
     - If user says "no": Acknowledge and proceed to Phase 4 checkpoint (ask about push anyway)
   - **STEP 3** (REQUIRED): If tests fail, use Task tool to analyze and fix failures, then re-run tests until they pass
   - **CHECKPOINT**: Must reach this point before Phase 4 - commit confirmation MUST be asked

   **PHASE 4: Push to Remote**
   - **STEP 1** (REQUIRED): After successful commit (or commit decline), MUST ask: "Changes committed successfully. Do you want to push the changes to remote? (yes/no)"
     - If no commit was made, ask: "Do you want to push any existing commits to remote? (yes/no)"
   - **STEP 2** (REQUIRED): If user says "yes", use Task tool to push changes to remote
   - **CHECKPOINT**: Push confirmation MUST be asked - this is the final step of the workflow

**üö® CRITICAL WORKFLOW - STRICT PHASE SEQUENCE:**

This workflow has **4 MANDATORY PHASES** that MUST be executed in order. Each phase has **REQUIRED CHECKPOINTS** that CANNOT be skipped:

**PHASE 1: Collection Phase**
- ONLY collect decisions (yes/no/skip/all) and create tasks - NO execution
- **CHECKPOINT**: ALL comments have been presented and user decisions collected

**PHASE 2: Execution Phase**
- ONLY execute tasks after ALL comments reviewed - NO more questions
- Process ALL approved tasks
- **CHECKPOINT**: ALL approved tasks have been completed

**PHASE 3: Testing & Commit Phase**
- **MANDATORY STEP 1**: Run tests via Task tool
- **MANDATORY STEP 2**: If tests pass, MUST ask user: "All tests pass. Do you want to commit the changes? (yes/no)"
- **MANDATORY STEP 3**: If user says yes, use Task tool to commit changes
- **CHECKPOINT**: Tests completed AND commit confirmation asked (even if user declined)

**PHASE 4: Push Phase**
- **MANDATORY STEP 1**: After successful commit, MUST ask user: "Changes committed successfully. Do you want to push the changes to remote? (yes/no)"
- **MANDATORY STEP 2**: If user says yes, use Task tool to push changes
- **CHECKPOINT**: Push confirmation asked (even if user declined)

**üö® ENFORCEMENT RULES:**
- **NEVER skip phases** - all 4 phases are mandatory
- **NEVER skip checkpoints** - each phase must reach its checkpoint before proceeding
- **NEVER skip confirmations** - commit and push confirmations are REQUIRED even if previously discussed
- **NEVER assume** - always ask for confirmation, never assume user wants to commit/push
- **COMPLETE each phase fully** before starting the next phase

**If tests fail**: Use Task tool to analyze and fix failures, then re-run tests until they pass before proceeding to Phase 3's commit confirmation.

Note: Human review comments are treated equally (no priority system like CodeRabbit).
