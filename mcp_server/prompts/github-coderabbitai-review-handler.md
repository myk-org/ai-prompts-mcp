# github-coderabbitai-review-handler

**Description:** Finds and processes CodeRabbit AI comments from the current branch's GitHub PR with priority-based handling.

## Instructions

**Step 1: Get CodeRabbit comments using the extraction script**

```bash
# Call the CodeRabbit extraction script with PR info script path
{{SCRIPT_PATHS}}
```

**Step 2: Process the JSON output**

The script returns structured JSON containing:
- `summary`: Counts of actionable, nitpicks, duplicates, outside_diff_range (if any), and total
- `actionable_comments`: Array of HIGH priority issues with AI instructions (body contains direct AI prompts)
  - Each has: priority, title, file, body (body = AI instruction to execute)
- `nitpick_comments`: Array of LOW priority style/maintainability issues with clean descriptions  
  - Each has: priority, title, file, line, body
- `duplicate_comments`: Array of MEDIUM priority duplicates (only present if any exist)
  - Each has: priority, title, file, line, body
- `outside_diff_range_comments`: Array of LOW priority comments on code outside the diff (only present if any exist)
  - Each has: priority, title, file, line, body

**Step 2.5: Filter Positive Comments from Duplicates**

üéØ **CRITICAL: Before presenting MEDIUM priority comments to user, classify each duplicate comment to filter out positive feedback.**

For each comment in `duplicate_comments` (if any exist), analyze the title and body to determine:

**POSITIVE (Filter Out) - Comments that are:**
- Praise/acknowledgment: Contains words like "good", "great", "nice", "excellent", "perfect", "well done", "correct"
- Positive feedback on fixes: "good fix", "nice improvement", "better approach", "correct implementation"
- Acknowledgment without suggestions: No action words like "should", "consider", "recommend", "suggest", "try"

**ACTIONABLE (Keep) - Comments that:**
- Contain suggestions: "should", "consider", "recommend", "suggest", "could", "might want to"
- Point out issues: "issue", "problem", "concern", "potential", "risk"
- Request changes: "change", "update", "modify", "improve", "refactor"

**Examples:**
- ‚úÖ POSITIVE (filter out): "Windows-safe resource import guard: good portability fix"
- ‚úÖ POSITIVE (filter out): "Nice error handling improvement"
- ‚ùå ACTIONABLE (keep): "Consider adding error handling here"
- ‚ùå ACTIONABLE (keep): "This could cause performance issues"

After classification, remove all POSITIVE comments from the `duplicate_comments` array before proceeding to Step 3.

**Step 3: PHASE 1 - Collect User Decisions (COLLECTION ONLY - NO PROCESSING)**

**üö® CRITICAL: This is the COLLECTION phase. Do NOT execute, implement, or process ANY comments yet. Only ask questions and create tasks.**

Go through ALL comments in priority order, collecting user decisions:
1. **HIGH Priority (Actionable)** first
2. **MEDIUM Priority (Duplicates)** - if any exist  
3. **LOW Priority (Nitpicks)** last

**IMPORTANT: Present each comment individually, WAIT for user response, but NEVER execute, implement, or process anything during this phase.**

For actionable comments, present:
```
ü§ñ AI Instruction (HIGH Priority) - Comment X of Y
üìÅ File: [file path]
üìã Title: [title]
üéØ Instruction: [body - this is the AI prompt to execute]

Execute this AI instruction? (yes/no/skip/all)
```

For nitpicks/duplicates, present:
```
üî¥ Priority: [MEDIUM/LOW] - Comment X of Y
üìÅ File: [file path]
üìç Line: [line]
üìã Title: [title]
üí¨ Description: [body]

Do you want to address this comment? (yes/no/skip/all)
```

**For each "yes" response:**
- Create a TodoWrite task with appropriate agent assignment
- Show confirmation: "‚úÖ Task created: [brief description]"
- **DO NOT execute the task - Continue to next comment immediately**

**For "all" response:**
- Create TodoWrite tasks for the current comment AND all remaining comments automatically
- Show summary: "‚úÖ Created tasks for current comment + X remaining comments"
- **Skip to Phase 2 immediately**

**For "no" or "skip" responses:**
- Show: "‚è≠Ô∏è Skipped"
- Continue to next comment immediately

**üö® REMINDER: Do NOT execute, implement, fix, or process anything during this phase. Only collect decisions and create tasks.**

**Step 4: PHASE 2 - Process All Approved Tasks (EXECUTION PHASE)**

**üö® IMPORTANT: Only start this phase AFTER all comments have been presented and decisions collected.**

After ALL comments have been reviewed in Phase 1:

1. **Show approved tasks and proceed directly:**

```
üìã Processing X approved tasks:
1. [Task description]
2. [Task description]
...
```
Proceed directly to execution (no confirmation needed since user already approved each task in Phase 1)

2. **Process all approved tasks:**
   - **HIGH Priority (Actionable)**: Execute AI instructions directly using body as prompt
   - **MEDIUM/LOW Priority**: Route to appropriate specialists using Task tool
   - Process multiple tasks in parallel when possible
   - Mark each task as completed after finishing

3. **Post-execution workflow:**
   - **Run tests**: Use Task tool to select appropriate agent to run all tests
   - **If tests pass**: Ask user "All tests pass. Do you want to commit the changes? (yes/no)"
   - **If user says yes**: Use Task tool to select appropriate agent to commit changes with descriptive message
   - **After successful commit**: Ask user "Changes committed successfully. Do you want to push the changes to remote? (yes/no)"
   - **If user says yes to push**: Use Task tool to select appropriate agent to push changes to remote repository
   - **If tests fail**: Use Task tool to select appropriate agent to analyze and fix test failures, then re-run tests until they pass

**üö® CRITICAL WORKFLOW:**
- **Phase 1**: ONLY collect decisions (yes/no/skip/all) and create tasks - NO execution
- **Phase 2**: ONLY execute tasks after ALL comments reviewed - NO more questions
- **Phase 3**: Run tests via Task tool, then ask for commit confirmation and use Task tool for git operations if tests pass
- **Phase 4**: After successful commit, ask for push confirmation and use Task tool for git push if approved

**NEVER mix the phases. Complete each phase fully before starting the next.**
